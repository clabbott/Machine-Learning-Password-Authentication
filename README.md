# Machine-Learning-Password-Authentication
Project for Northrup Grumman UMD Student Cybersecurity Challenge

This project is an extension of the concepts used in JHACKS-JUI-Project. We changed the project by changing the biometrics gathering from a game into just a simple KeyReader while a password is typed. 
These biometrics are then run through a Neural Network which determines whether the user biometrics match the training data associated with the username given. 
The Neural Network returns true if the label matches and false if it does not.
